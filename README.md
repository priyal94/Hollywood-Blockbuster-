# Hollywood-Blockbuster

## Summary
Predicting a movie’s success is a challenging task due to a high degree of variation in its success rate. In this case study, the goal is to develop a predictive model that will enable us to outperform the classification accuracy achieved in previous academic models. The movies are classified ranging from 1 to 9[1] categories where 1 is assumed to be a flop movie whereas 9 is assumed to be a blockbuster. I have explored the data set by performing exploratory data analysis on various features, applied NLP techniques on textual data, and implemented supervised machine learning model Decision Tree and Ensemble method Random Forest for classification. Random Forest is selected as the final model as it outperforms other models in terms of cross-validation accuracy.
